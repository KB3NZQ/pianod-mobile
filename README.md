pianod-mobile
=============
This is a Titanium Mobile application to control Pianod (http://deviousfish.com/pianod/)

Theoretically, if you build this on a Mac, it should "just work" as I intentially
avoided any iOS or Android-specific irregularities.

It's not entirely bug-free, either. If you find the App not responding to your
commands, simply back out of the application and restart it, login
and it will start working just fine.

It doesn't survive wifi outage very well right now - but that should be rectified soon....
